<h4>
A to-do app, short for a to-do list application, is a software tool designed to assist users in organizing, managing, and tracking their tasks or activities. These applications typically provide a user-friendly interface where individuals can input and categorize their tasks, set priorities, assign deadlines, and monitor progress. To-do apps are commonly used to enhance productivity, help users prioritize their work, and ensure that important deadlines are met. Many modern to-do apps also offer additional features such as collaboration tools, reminders, and synchronization across multiple devices to provide a comprehensive solution for task management.</h4>
